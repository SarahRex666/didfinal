Nothing about her personality or her behavior made me feel this way. Just a complete and unending certainty that she was a harbinger. She talked of dead pets, dead friends, dead parents, of art and of love. These were the things she was an expert in. Her shoulders straightened, gaze evened. The look of an athlete about to run the big race.",

Her pale wavy hair wild and uncontrollable, my sitting across from her as still as stone. Off in the distance, maybe outside, I heard a hiss and the movement of leaves. When she departed, something in me left with her. After the door closed and her car pulled away I collapsed in bed and slept for fourteen hours."

I’ll give you an example: I know that the first words ever spoken were probably something like water or lion or run or fire, something necessary, something vital. But I like to believe that maybe after thousands of years of silence, someone looked at someone and said, “I wonder if those stars watch us every night like we watch them.” I think that would be nice, don’t you? Or maybe if God came down one Tuesday afternoon and everybody got out of their cars or walked out of their incredibly important jobs and he just said, “what are you in a rush for all the time?

They worked until the building was completed — master builders, artists, laborers, clowns, noblemen, priests, burghers.

One white oak tree hung over it, a remnant of the old pine barrens on the east end of Long Island. Most were destroyed to make room for cash crops, vineyards and summer homes. Besides the one tree there was nothing but weeds and overgrown grass inside. I don’t know why they would keep people out of an empty lot. But the woman was there, picking up sticks of uniform length and thickness and bundling them under her arm. She examined each as if they were slipped under the plexiglass of a pawnshop. These were precious things. As she bent to pick them up her white and grey and black and brown hair fell off her shoulder and nearly touched the ground.
